# Sampling random covariance matrices for multivariate binary distributions

See [notes](https://github.com/maxbiostat/sampling_binary_covariances/blob/main/notes/sampling_binary_covariance.pdf) for the problem description. 

In short, given a P-dimensional vector of marginal probabilities **m**, we want to sample a matrix **C** (uniformly) from the space of covariance matrices compatible with **m**, `Q(**m**)`.
